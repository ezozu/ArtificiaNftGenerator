# ArtificiaNftGenerator

## Description

A generative adversarial network (GAN) powered NFT art engine utilizing a novel attention-based convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, enabling real-time style transfer and adaptive rarity scoring for procedurally generated digital art assets.

## Features

- Here are 7 technical features for the ArtificiaNftGenerator software project:
- "Utilizes generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create unique, algorithmicallygenerated art pieces",
- "Employs natural language processing (NLP) to analyze and incorporate userprovided text prompts into artwork",
- "Leverages computer vision techniques to ensure generated art conforms to userdefined style and aesthetic preferences",
- "Integrates with popular digital wallets to enable seamless, secure NFT minting and storage",
- "Provides a Pythonbased API for developers to access and extend the art generation capabilities",
- "Supports realtime rendering of 3D models and animations using WebGL and Three.js",
- "Includes a metadata editor for users to add custom attributes and provenance information to generated NFTs"
- Let me know if you need any adjustments or additional features!
